# OVERVIEW

This is a self-guided project aimed at determining whether or not there is a link between incidents of terrorism and economic factors, specifically GDP per capita, inflation, and unemployment. The final results of my analysis can be found in the script "6.7 Creating Data Dashboards" and as an interactive Tableau presentation to be viewed in full screen. 

## OBJECTIVE

This analysis was made to identify and understand the complex interactions between natural hazards, infrastructure resilience and socio-economic vulnerability as reflected in the WorldRiskIndex. It aims to uncover patterns in the interaction of the dimensions that could contribute to data-driven decision-making and support disaster risk management possibilities.

The analysis is therefore guided by the question: "How do complex interactions between natural hazard exposure, infrastructure resilience and socioeconomic vulnerability contribute to policies that can inform data-driven disaster risk management?"

## MOTIVATION

Millions of people around the world face the consequences of extreme natural events such as earthquakes, storms, and floods. While the intensity of these events is important, the societal framework and response structures are equally critical in determining the magnitude of the disaster.

The WorldRiskReport aims to contribute to a global view of the links between natural hazards, climate change, development and disaster risk reduction and to draw forward-looking conclusions for aid, policy making and reporting.

## KEY QUESTIONS

The analysis is therefore guided by these questions:

\- "How do complex interactions between natural hazard exposure, infrastructure resilience and socioeconomic vulnerability contribute to policies that can inform data-driven disaster risk management?

\- “Which regions or countries are most exposed to natural catastrophes?”

\- “Are there patterns in risk index scores based on geographic factors?”

## PROJECT TASKS & SCRIPT STRUCTURE

-   k-means cluster analysis

## PYTHON LIBRARIES

Used in Jupyter notebooks

-   Pandas: for data analysis
-   Numpy: for mathematical equations
-   Seaborn: for beautiful and stylish data visualizations
-   Matplotlib: for highly customizable data visualizations
-   SciPy: for mathematical equations
-   Folium: for geospatial visualizations
-   Scikit Learn: for machine learning algorithms

## DATA SOURCE

- ["World Disaster Risk Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tr1gg3rtrash/global-disaster-risk-index-time-series-dataset) by Mrinal Tyagi, accessed via Kaggle: It is showcasing the WorldRiskIndex (WRI) that measures disaster risk from extreme natural events and climate change impacts, calculated per country by combining exposure and vulnerability in this report.
-  ["Human Development Index"](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) provided by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP): The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and having a decent standard of living.

## LIMITATIONS

-   The data lacks information on actual disaster events, which precludes analysis of their dynamics and impacts on countries.
-   The WorldRiskIndex may not fully capture the complexities of disaster risk which often includes political and economic factors that are simply not in the data.
-   Continuous index updates (more frequently than annually) would allow for a better assessment of potential trends and seasonality.
